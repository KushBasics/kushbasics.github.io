<h1>The True Costs of Buying a New Motorcycle:</h1>
<p>*(Shiny new motorcycle with sparkle pic)</p>

<br /><br /><br />
<p>Many of you probably want to hop onto a brand new motorcycle as fast as you possibly can. Who doesn't? While you might be anxious to hit the ground running, I am here to remind you to be prepared – mentally, physically, and financially. I am going to detail all of the costs of buying a brand new motorcycle, from the bike itself, to the gear, to the insurance, to the accessories.</p>

<p>I am not doing this to rain on your parade, but to help you realize that buying a bike is not just the MSRP plus the cost of a helmet. There are a lot of other costs to be aware of if you want to ride safely - and legally. It is also a good idea to start planning to buy a bike weeks or even months before you do so. This gives you ample time to budget, research your bike, try on and buy gear that fits well, get your endorsement, get quotes from dealers, and even take a safety course.</p>

<p>The first thing new riders see is the MSRP of a brand new bike, and I am going to stop you right there. You need to understand that there are various other costs associated with purchasing, owning, and maintaining a brand new bike. Many of these things you already know, but it is important to put the true total costs in perspective. You can write these things down yourself as they apply to you, or use the checklist and/or calculator provided at the end of this article to help you keep track. As these costs add up, you may also want to consider buying used - especially if this is your first bike.</p>

<h2>Costs to Consider Before You Ride:</h2>
<p>*(Picture of spreadsheet on computer screen with the words "motorcycle" and "gear" and "insurance")</p>
<p>Before purchasing the bike, you will want to have a few things in order. First and foremost, you will want to have a Motorcycle Endorsement on your driver's license, and there are a couple of ways to get it. Second, you will want to research which bike(s) you want and have an insurance quote(s) ready for when you make the purchase.</p>

<p>The first way you can get a Motorcycle Endorsement on your license is to find out what your state DMV requires for it. Most states will allow you to take an eye exam and a multiple choice test for a learner's permit which you will have to keep for six months or so before testing for the real endorsement. In most states, this permit restricts you in some way (no riding at night, no passengers, no highway riding, etc.). In general, the endorsement itself will cost you about $10, and your state DMV may require that they reissue you a brand new license, which can run you another $20-$30. Check <a href="http://www.dmv.org">DMV.org</a> or your local state DMV website for specific information regarding your endorsement.</p>

<p>The other option for getting your endorsement is something that you should ABSOLUTELY do anyway: Take a Motorcycle Safety Course!</p>

<p>Taking a motorcycle safety course has many benefits. First, you gain real experience on a motorcycle and learn (or if you are an experienced rider, review) the basics of how to ride a motorcycle safely and effectively. Second, in almost every state, you can use the completion card you get to the DMV to skip (yes, SKIP!) the riding portion of your test. This means that you can go to the DMV with your completion card, take the eye exam and multiple choice test, and get your endorsement that same day! If that is not enough, almost every insurance company out there will instantly give you a significant discount for taking a safety course of some sort every 2-3 years (depends on company). In addition, many motorcycle rider clubs (HRCA, GTRC, other motorcycle clubs) will actually refund part of the cost of taking a Motorcycle Safety Course.</p>

<p>These classes run at about $200 each, but remember that there is a lot to gain from them – both mentally and financially. I highly recommend you take a course.</p>

<p>Also worthy of mention is that some states will issue you a motorcycle endorsement with tiered restrictions. Take Utah for example: if you test on a 249cc bike or lower, you may only ride a motorcycle with that cc range. The same goes for 250cc up to 649cc. However, if you test on a 650cc bike or higher, you can ride ANY motorcycle, which means your license has no restrictions and you do not have to make another trip to the DMV if you ever upgrade to a larger motorcycle. The safety courses will usually let you retest on your own bike, or even on one of their bikes for a small fee ($25-$50).</p>

<p>This means that while you usually test on a 250cc bike or lower at the end of the safety course, you can test again on a 650cc bike, take your completion card saying that you passed on a 650cc bike to the DMV, and get an endorsement with no restrictions! This will save you time and money down the road, so consider that aspect of the safety course as well.</p>

<p>Finally, pick out the bike (or, bikes) that you will probably get. Go to your local insurance agent or shop online and obtain an insurance quote for how much it would be to insure the bike(s). Learn about every single discount your insurance company offers and how to take advantage of it. Make sure to mention if you have riding experience, that you will have an endorsement (they will need to copy it once you have it), that you will take a safety course (they will need the completion card to apply the discount), and that you are a member of a motorcycle club (they will need your Member ID). Get the quote ready before you buy the bike so that you know how much it costs and so you will be able to activate your coverage as soon as you buy the bike and obtain the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN). You do not EVER want to drive without insurance.</p>

<p>Also, remember that insurance companies offer discounts for paying the entire year up front, and some companies will even offer to suspend your insurance (“lay-up” or “lay-away”) for a few months out of the year. This is more common in states with harsh winters and/or considerably wet springs. It never hurts to ask. :)</p>

<h2>The Bike:</h2>
<p>*(Pic of man pondering a few bikes in a showroom)</p>
<p>Ah, the bike itself. Are you going with a sport bike? A cruiser? An off-road bike? A dual-purpose bike? It is all so much fun! The costs between these styles of bikes can vary in the end, but let's just go ahead and start at the MSRP.</p>

<p>The MSRP of the bike is the Manufacturer Suggested Retail Price. This is the price that you will see at most dealerships, although it is important to remember that some dealerships, especially those in more pricy states like California or New York, may have a price above the MSRP if their taxes or costs of holding the bike are higher than other dealerships. This may also be the case if demand is high for that model of bike. Still, in most cases you will be able to negotiate at or around the MSRP of the bike. Why? Because this is not really where dealerships make most of their money. Read on.</p>

<p>In addition to the MSRP of the bike, you will need to pay State Sales Tax (Varies), possibly Property Tax (Varies), and a plethora of various fees. These fees can include, but are not limited to, an “Assembly” fee, a “Floor” fee, a “Drop” fee, and various general “Dealer” fees. Make sure that when you are asking about the price of a bike, you ask for an Out the Door (OTD) price with all of the fees detailed. Some dealers will hesitate, but persist politely. This will give you a better idea of how much you are actually paying for and what you can negotiate. In some cases, it is wise to ensure that the OTD price is actually what they will charge you. You can confirm this by saying something to the effect of “So, if I bring a Cashier's Check for this amount from my bank,  it will suffice?”Make sure you write down the price of everything they quote, and compare them between dealers! :)</p>

<p>Before you actually go and buy the bike, join a motorcycle club for the brand of bike you are getting. Almost all of them are free. You might even end up saving money on insurance, and, as mentioned above, many motorcycle clubs will refund you part of the costs of the motorcycle safety course. This is almost always an instant savings on your insurance. You can find a list of motorcycle clubs here.</p>

<p>State Sales Tax is a percentage-based tax on buying items that your state may or may not charge. While a few states have no sales tax, almost all the rest of them do. Check your state tax rate here and multiply the MSRP by the tax rate to find what you will pay in state sales tax for the bike.</p>

<p>Property Tax is a tax charged by some states when acquiring new or used property. Long story short, it is yet another tax that you might have to pay when buying new or used. It varies by states, and is sometimes done in a tiered manner. This means that some year model bikes are in a different tier and are therefore charged a different property tax amount. Check your state DMV website for information regarding property tax, or DMV.org  for more general state-by-state information.</p>

<p>An “Assembly” fee is charged for labor in putting a brand new bike together. When dealers receive new motorcycles, they usually arrive in a crate of some sort and need minor assembly. In some cases, the motorcycle is almost completely finished and the laborer merely has to pop open the crate and tighten a few screws, but in some cases there is more assembly required. Dealers may charge you for this assembly. I have personally seen this fee vary from $25 to $150 for the same bike at different dealerships! Some places do not even quote this fee at all. Go figure.</p>

<p>A “Drop” fee is the fee that dealers charge for having the bike delivered to them. Obviously, dealers pay below the MSRP price for a brand new motorcycle since they get them directly from the manufacturer. However, they also have to have the bike shipped and delivered to them. This generally averages out to about $200-$400 depending on the state and the vicinity of the dealership to the manufacturer. Once again, be prepared to be quoted this fee, but know that there is always room for negotiation.</p>

<p>A “Floor” fee refers to the fee associated with a dealer keeping the bike on the floor. Pretty shady, huh? Well it is part of how dealers make money. Know that in any business, it is important to account for inventory costs and asset depreciation, so this fee is honestly not as sneaky as you might initially think. Once again, however, there is usually room to negotiate.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most vague of all, “Dealer” fees can be the most frustrating part of buying a brand new bike. Dealer fees can be anything from helping you fill out registration to the dealer actually charging you for the time it takes for an employee to help you finish the purchase and fill out paperwork. Many times, these fees are added on because most customers do not give them a second look. I have seen dealer fees range from none at all to $800! Yes, $800! You will want to ask the dealer exactly what the dealer fees consist of and how much they will total before committing to buy a motorcycle from them. If the dealer does not want to give a set price, persist politely, but also be prepared to respectfully walk away, as this could be a money trap. Know that you can fill out most of the paperwork without their help and that they are merely being courteous when helping you do so.</p>

<p>Registration and DMV fees consist of registering your bike's information and obtaining the title through the state where you purchased the bike, as well as paying any other fees your DMV requires. Remember that you have to register your bike in the state where it was purchased. This is important to remember if you are buying a motorcycle in a different state than the one where you permanently reside. The dealer will almost always take care of the registration for you, and this is usually included as part of the “Dealer” fees mentioned above.</p>

<p>Most states require you to have a Safety and/or Emissions Inspection done on your bike. Proof of inspection(s) are then turned into the DMV. Many dealers can do this for you and even turn the papers in with your registration. Also, few states require additional tests for motorcycles, but consult your local DMV website or DMV.org for more details.</p>

<h3>REMINDER! BUY THE INSURANCE:</h3>

<p>If you read above, you should already know the cost of insurance by the time you are ready to buy the bike. Remember to take advantage of the Motorcycle Safety Course discounts, Motorcycle Club discounts, lay-away or suspension discounts, and any other discounts your insurance company offers. Call your insurance company with the VIN and immediately activate your insurance once the bike is yours. Print off a temporary insurance form either at the dealer (perhaps ask if you can borrow their computer to do so), at home, or at your local insurance agent's office, before driving the motorcycle off the lot. At the very least, obtain a policy number that you can write down and carry with you on the first ride home. Once again, you NEVER want to drive a motorcycle without insurance!</p>

<h2>Gear:</h2>
<p>*(Pic of rider standing upright with full gear, tightening glove)</p>
<p>There are many pieces of gear you will need to operate a motorcycle safely. What I will mention here are the essentials and some basic information about what to look for. You can read more about fit and how to pick out every piece of gear in full detail here.</p>

<p>In addition, remember to try on the gear that you are going to purchase! DO NOT order gear online until you've tried the same piece of equipment on, seen how it fits, and know exactly what you are going to buy (Company, model, size, etc.). Only then should you search the internet for the best price for a specific piece of gear. Even then, remember to include shipping in the calculation of costs. Fit is an integral part of buying gear, and could easily be the difference between life and death should you get in an accident.</p>

<p>Your Helmet is the most important piece of gear you can have on you at any time. Without delving into statistics, it is imperative that you understand that your head will always lose a fight with the asphalt, no matter how hard your spouse says it is. I personally recommend a full-faced helmet, as it offers the most protection. A decent helmet fits tightly when you buy it, and although the padding eases with time, is NEVER loose. Unless you are an expert, DO NOT buy helmets used, and remember that if you drop a helmet from waist height or hit it in such a way that there is a noticeable dent or indentation of any sort, you have to buy a new one. Period. When this happens, the structural integrity of the outside (impact) layer of the helmet has been permanently compromised, and will not protect you effectively in a crash. Treat it with care! A helmet must have the Department of Transportation (DOT) stamp on the back of it at the very least. A Snell Foundation sticker on the back is an added bonus. Generally, a good helmet will run you somewhere between $300-$600. Anything more than that is either overpriced or has extra features that you may not need. Do your research, but above all, be safe!</p>

<p>A decent Jacket fits you snugly (there are no areas of the jacket loose enough to bundle up and catch on the ground if you fell, causing you to roll), but lets you maneuver decently when sitting on the bike. A good jacket will also have longer sleeves to protect you when your arms are extended in a riding position. A jacket must have armored elbows and shoulders that meet safety standards listed here, and must have room for you to insert or wear chest and back armor that also meets those safety standards. Other features to look for in jackets include a removable inline (one that provides extra warmth or comfort, and that can be removed during warmer months), vent zippers, pockets, a collar (or lack thereof depending on where you live) and so forth.</p>

<p>If you are riding a motorcycle, Gloves will keep your fingers from going numb and protect your hands if you ever fall. In many accidents, riders extend their arms forward and sometimes their hands absorb much of the initial blow of the fall. To keep your hands warm and prevent road rash (or worse), gloves are an essential part of your motorcycle gear. Gloves should be made of a durable material such as leather, and for extra protection, should be thicker around the more sensitive areas of your hand. Armor or extra padding around the knuckles or parts of the fingers is preferred. For extra safety, get gloves that go at least an inch or so below the wrist, although anything more than that (eg. Gauntlets) is a matter of function and preference, as your sleeves from your jacket should protect the bottom of your wrist to some extent. Also, remember that you may want to invest in two or more pairs of gloves depending on the weather where you live. For example, you may not want to be wearing thinner, more breathable gloves during colder months, or thicker, less breathable gloves during hotter months. You may also prefer a different pair of gloves if you take the bike off-road or onto a track.</p>

<p>To protect your feet and ankles, proper Footwear is an absolute must! Without proper footwear, you may be left with permanent injuries should you ever get into an accident. In extreme cases, you may even lose your feet! It is imperative to wear a shoe or boot that is made of a durable material, that extends to (or above) the ankle, has a thick (preferably stinted) insole, is comfortable and maneuverable to ensure that you can shift gears and brake efficiently, is weather-appropriate, and has a thick, non-slip material on the bottom to ensure that you will always be able to put your feet down comfortably while maintaining control given most weather conditions. Finally, for those more prone to ignoring details for purposes of rationalization, if this description was not clear enough, you should never, under any circumstances, wear flip-flops or sandals.</p>

<p>Pants are another important part of motorcycle gear. Like your jacket, you want a snug, but comfortable fit, and do not want any part of it to be loose enough to bundle up on itself and cause you to roll during a fall. You will want the pants to be made out of a durable material (such as leather), and will want to have padding in important places such as your knees, thighs, and shins if your footwear does not protect them adequately. In various cases (track or off-road), you may want pants made of a lighter material or even additional padding in other places such as your shin, groin, tailbone, or other places. The more safety, the better. Just remember that if you decide to ride around town or on the freeway wearing shorts, sweatpants, or light jeans, it is your responsibility to live with and pay for the road rash (or worse) you end up with if you fall. Also, avoid baggy clothes at all costs, as looser clothing can interfere with your ability to operate the motorcycle (pants get caught on shifter or brake, etc.). Finally, on some bikes that have a side exhaust near your legs, be careful not to wear a material that can melt near or on a hot exhaust – it happens more often than one would think.</p>

<p>Depending on the features of the gear you purchased, you may want (or need) to invest in Additional Armor and/or Pads to complement and complete the safety of your gear. For example, if you find a motorcycle jacket on sale that has everything you need, but does not have a very long or durable back pad, you may want to buy the jacket, take the back pad out, and replace it with a longer and more durable one. Perhaps you are set on only wearing jeans, but want to buy knee pads just in case? Remember to be as safe as possible and purchase anything else you need to make your safety a reality.</p>

<p>Finally, depending on the bike and your living situation, you may want to invest in numerous Accessories. Perhaps you intend to use the bike as your primary mode of transportation or will use it on trips and will need some saddlebags, or you are living in an apartment or don't have a garage and need a motorcycle enclosure or cover to protect the bike from the elements? Maybe you went all out and bought </p>

<p>I hope that you now see that buying a brand new motorcycle can be more expensive than you think. If you are still set on buying a motorcycle new, go ahead and print off the cost checklist provided below. If, however, this is a bit too pricy, you may also want to consider Buying Used. In addition, some of the things you should get for your motorcycle can be purchased used, such as a few of the pieces of gear and accessories. You can save a lot of money going this route, but do not skimp at the expense of your safety.</p>

<p>In addition, remember that all of the information listed in this article was merely scratching the surface. You will want to read more about gear, and also start thinking about various accessories you may want for your motorcycle. When all is said and done, however, just make sure to get on a motorcycle as fast as you can! There really is no feeling quite like it. Happy riding! :)</p>
