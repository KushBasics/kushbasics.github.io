	<p>Everyone should try riding a motorcycle - except hippies. As badass as motorcycles are, there are many things riders give up, especially when compared to a car. I have tried to outline some of the most important things to consider when thinking about buying and owning a motorcycle. While new riders usually just want to jump on a bike, I implore you to please be aware of the potential downsides - you certainly do not want any surprises.</p>

	<h2>Pros</h2>
	
	<br />
	
	<h4 class="red">Cost</h4>
	
	<p>Compared to a car, a cheap or medium-priced motorcycle will probably cost you less over the lifetime of the vehicle. Unless you own a rare or pricy model, parts, upkeep, and service jobs for a motorcycle are usually cheaper or simpler than for cars. While it might not always make practical sense to buy a motorcycle before buying a car, it often makes great financial and practical sense to purchase a motorcycle over a car as a second vehicle.</p>
	
	<h4 class="red">Fuel Economy</h4>
	
	<p>Even the fastest sport bikes are capable of getting upwards of 40 mpg (~17 kpl), and many motorcycles can get nearly twice that. Whether you are running quick errands around the city or commuting a fair distance, riding a motorcycle instead of driving your car can pay off noticeably and quickly.</p>
	
	<h4 class="red">Freedom</h4>
	
	<p>Because motorcycles cost less to operate and generally get great mileage, motorcycle riders have an extra financial incentive to go out and do things they might not otherwise do. While normal drivers are certainly capable of coming and going as they please, I noticed that when I started riding, trails and parks even a couple hundred miles away somehow felt that much closer, as I knew it would cost almost nothing to make the trip. Further, there is nothing like getting on your motorcycle to escape boredom for a couple of hours or to clear your head.</p>
	
	<h4 class="red">Fun</h4>
	
	<p>Motorcycles are fun, plain and simple. “Fun” means something different to everyone, but when it comes to recreational uses, to have the same type of fun with a car you would have to spend tens of thousands of dollars more. Want to travel off-road? You can spend $5,000-$6,000 for a great off-road or dual sport bike, or $25,000 for a Jeep - and that is before customization. Want a vehicle that will take you 0-60 mph (~0-100 km/h) in under 4 seconds? You can spend close to $100,000 on a Porsche 911 Turbo, or just buy a decent sport bike for around $10,000 (or for even less used).</p>
	
	<h4 class="red">Parking</h4>
	
	<p>While experiences vary, riding a motorcycle usually gives you more parking options than cars. Motorcycles can squeeze into spaces that cars simply cannot, and riders can often create their own spaces. Have you ever been denied a parking space for your car because a subpar driver could not park straight? Well, guess what? Your motorcycle can still use that space. Some towns and cities will even let you park on the sidewalk outside of businesses and restaurants. In addition, for prospective riders in college, many college campuses have designated motorcycle parking areas that are often closer to the buildings, and quite often the permits for these spaces cost less than for cars. Check with your local laws, but for the most part, as long as your bike is not in the way, no one really cares.</p>
	
	<h4 class="red">The "Cool" Factor</h4> 
	
	<p>Speaking both objectively and scientifically, riding a motorcycle is just plain awesome. It has been demonstrably proven that once you have mastered the ride, riding a motorcycle increases how cool you feel by at least one billion percent, give or take about a 3% margin of error. )</p>

	<h2>Cons</h2>

	<br />
	
	<h4 class="red">Increased Involvement while Riding</h4> 
	
	<p>Riding a motorcycle is a lot more involved than driving a car. You cannot turn on cruise control, stretch your legs, drink your beverage, change the radio station and talk on your cell phone while steering with your thighs. Riding a motorcycle involves constant multi-tasking, the most basic being balancing the vehicle while holding down the throttle to maintain speed. To ride safely, you should never lose concentration while on your motorcycle or allow yourself to be distracted. If you try to multitask while riding a motorcycle, moving your hands or feet away from where they should be, you are diminishing your ability to react to potential situations and developments on the road. While all drivers should abide by the same standards, I would argue that cars are more forgiving.</p>
	
	<h4 class="red">Extreme Weather</h4>
	
	<p>Riding during Spring and Fall can be absolutely invigorating, but Summer and Winter will come eventually. Most of us do not live in Southern California and actually have to experience all four seasons.  When you ride during wet, cold, humid, windy, or hot weather, you may start to miss the dry, air-conditioned environment that a covered vehicle provides. While you can buy extra gear to combat many of these conditions, showing up to work one day covered in sweat or drenched by an unexpected downpour is to be expected.</p>
	
	<h4 class="red">Safety</h4>
	
	<p>Despite what many people tell you, motorcycles can be driven safely. Taking a safety course and wearing proper gear reduces many risks, but the reality is motorcycles are still inherently less safe than a car if you are involved in an accident. The main difference is, when you are on a motorcycle, you have to be worried about other drivers to the point of paranoia. If you do not adopt the practices discussed in the safety sections, you are setting yourself up for ruin. Even if you did nothing wrong, being hit by a careless driver is far less forgiving on a motorcycle than it is within the thin steel fortress of even the smallest cars.</p>
	
	<h4 class="red">More Frequent Fill-ups</h4>
	
	<p>Motorcycles have smaller gas tanks than cars. While they often get better mileage, you may need to fill up more often depending on your bike, driving style, and the size of your tank.</p>
	
	<h4 class="red">Off-Season Storage</h4>
	
	<p>If you live in an area with harsh winters, you may need to store your motorcycle during the off-season. If you have a garage, this will not cost much more than a can of fuel stabilizer and an hour or two of your time, but if you do not, be aware of the added costs and inconveniences of storing your bike elsewhere. On the bright side, however, many insurance companies offer off-season discounts.</p>
	
	<h4 class="red">Theft</h4>
	
	<p>Motorcycles are relatively easy to steal, and some models (namely sport bikes) are more attractive to thieves than others. I personally recommend a motorcycle enclosure and/or a cheap alarm system to protect your bike, but these do cost extra.</p>
	
	<h4 class="red">Extra Licensing</h4>
	
	<p>In most places, you will have to pay extra and take an additional test or two for a motorcycle license. This adds slightly more inconvenience to an already convoluted and often infuriating process.</p>
	
	<h4 class="red">Gear Cost</h4>
	
	<p>In addition to the maintenance costs of the motorcycle, you will have to consistently replace your gear to ride safely, which can be quite expensive. The more often you ride, the more often you will have to replace your gear. This is a cost that many riders overlook. For some perspective, keep in mind that many riders replace their helmets every 1-2 years, which by itself is hundreds of dollars.</p>
	
	<h4 class="red">Cargo</h4>
	
	<p>Motorcycles do not hold very much. Even if you invest in large saddlebags and an excellent trunk, motorcycles cannot hold anywhere near as much as a car – they do not even carry spare tires. Keep this in mind if you are thinking about purchasing a motorcycle and do not already own a car.</p>
	
	<h4 class="red">Cannot Drive in Reverse</h4>
	
	<p>This may not seem like a big deal to most people, but if you ever watch someone struggle to back their 400 pound (~181 kg) bike out after parking it at a downward angle, you will appreciate the letter “R” just a little bit more.</p>

<div class="col-xs-12">

	<p>In the sections above, I used many generalities, and some riders may find some aspects of these points debatable. I have tried to accurately categorize the above items for most riders, but everyone has differing riding experiences. Below are a few items that, in my experience, can be categorized as either pros or cons.</p>

</div>

<div class="col-xs-12">

	<h2>Debatable</h2>
	
	<br />

	<h4 class="red">Longer trips</h4>
	
	<p>A few hours of non-stop driving are no big deal for most riders. You may be a bit sore or uncomfortable if you didn't invest in the right accessories, but ultimately you are still happy with the ride. At some point, however, fatigue, soreness, and other unpleasant feelings can replace the euphoria of a pleasant ride. Everyone has different limits, but make sure you plan for fatigue or rest. Sadly, you cannot sleep in your motorcycle like you can with a car.</p>
	
	<h4 class="red">Insurance</h4>
	
	<p>In most cases, good motorcycle insurance will be significantly cheaper than good car insurance. For some pricier models and many sport bikes, however, this is often not true. If you buy one of these models, expect to pay huge premiums – especially if you are a newer rider or bought the bike brand new. Always check with your insurance agent (or better yet, multiple agents) to see what insurance would cost before buying a motorcycle.</p>
	
	<h4 class="red">Experiencing the Great Outdoors</h4>
	
	<p>While breathing in fresh air can be one of the perks of riding a motorcycle, breathing in unfiltered smog and scraping dead bugs off of your helmet are among the notable disadvantages. Further, as mentioned previously, you are more vulnerable to the elements when riding a motorcycle than driving a car. Enjoy the outdoors, but don’t be surprised by nature’s indifference.</p>
	
	<h4 class="red">Second Passenger</h4>
	
	<p>Most of us want to share our riding experience with friends or family, but if you are going to ride with a passenger, you must ensure that they have access to proper gear. This can be quite a pain, as few people are going to shell out hundreds of dollars of their own money so they can ride with you, and even if you buy gear for potential passengers, it is not going to fit everyone the same. It can be hard to say “No” to people who want to ride with you without being properly protected, but it is the right thing to do.</p>
	
	<h4 class="red">Life of the Engine</h4>
	
	<p>While I have heard rumors that the average motorcycle engine dies around 100,000 miles (~160,000 km), I have not come across any credible studies that have substantiated this, let alone accounted for manufacturers, engine types, driving styles, and the frequency of maintenance. It is my speculation that, like cars, the life of the engine depends on a variety of factors, and that how you drive the bike and take care of it significantly affects the life of the engine. Perhaps in time enlightening studies will be done to address this question.</p>
	
	<h4 class="red">Leather Pants</h4> 
	
	<p>Many people just want an excuse to wear leather pants. I will leave it to you to decide whether or not this is a good thing.</p>
